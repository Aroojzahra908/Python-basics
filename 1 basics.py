#single-line comment:
'''begins with a hash (#) symbol and is useful in mentioning that the whole
 line should be considered as a comment until the end of the line.'''

#Multi-line comment
''' is useful when we need to comment on many lines. You can also use a single-line comment, but using a multi-line instead of
 single-line comment is easy to comment on multiple lines.'''
#In Python Triple double quote (""") and single quote (''') are used for Multi-line commenting.
 #It is used at the beginning and end of the block to comment on the entire block. Hence it is also called block comments.


#Python Indentation

'''Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

By default, Python uses four spaces for indentation, and the programmer can manage it.'''

#Unpack a Collection
'''If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables.
 This is called unpacking.
Example
Unpack a list:'''

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
x,y,z=fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)'''
